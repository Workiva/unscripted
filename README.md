ink
=====

For



"Ink" command line scripts in no time, using modern programming constructs such
as classes and closures.

With ink, there is no need to prepare a command line script ahead of time.  Instead, you create a normal programming construct such as a function or class, and iterate on it as needed, and unscripted automatically transforms this into a command line interface for you."

Simply develop a normal programming construct, such as a function or class, annotate it with command line interface things as necessary, and let {package_name} automatically transform this into a command line script for you.

It basically applies the concept of inversion of control and dependency injection to command line scripts.
